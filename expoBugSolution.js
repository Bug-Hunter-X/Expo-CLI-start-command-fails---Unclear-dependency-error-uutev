The solution to this issue is not a single fix but rather a process of investigation and correction.  Here's a breakdown of steps:

1. **Verify `package.json`:** Carefully check your `package.json` file for any missing dependencies or version mismatches. Pay close attention to Expo-related packages.
2. **Clean Install:** Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to perform a clean installation of your project's dependencies.  Sometimes, cached packages can cause problems.
3. **Check Expo SDK Version:** Ensure your Expo SDK version is compatible with the other packages in your project.
4. **Examine Error Log:** If the initial error message was not very informative, carefully look through the complete log output.  It may provide clues towards the problematic package or module.
5. **Native Modules:** If your app includes native modules, ensure they are properly configured and compiled. This often requires platform-specific setup steps. If you are using React Native modules, verify that they are compatible with Expo and are added to your project through proper methods.
6. **Expo Upgrade:**  An outdated Expo CLI or SDK could cause issues. Try upgrading using `expo upgrade`.
7. **Cache Clearing (Advanced):** In some cases, clearing npm's cache (`npm cache clean --force`) might be necessary.  Be cautious with this step, as it removes all cached packages.   Consider using yarn's equivalent if applicable.  

By systematically following these steps, you should be able to isolate and resolve the dependency-related issue that prevents the Expo CLI `start` command from working.
