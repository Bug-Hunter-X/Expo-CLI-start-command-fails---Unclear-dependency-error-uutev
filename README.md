# Expo CLI Start Command Failure: Unclear Dependency Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI's `start` command. The error manifests as a vague or unhelpful message regarding missing or misconfigured dependencies. This makes identifying and resolving the problem challenging.  This example provides a scenario reproducing the issue and a potential solution.

## Reproducing the Issue

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to run `expo start`. The command will likely fail with an unclear error message related to dependencies.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully examining the `package.json` file for any missing or incorrect dependency specifications.  Manual installation or reinstallation of packages using `npm install` or `yarn install` is frequently needed. Checking for native module compatibility and ensuring that Expo's requirements are met is also crucial. See the `expoBugSolution.js` for more detailed instructions.
